## The Problem

AI coding assistants hallucinate. They suggest packages that don't exist, generate insecure code, and lose context mid-conversation. CouchLoop EQ catches these problems before they hit production.

| Problem | What Happens | CouchLoop EQ Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| 🎭 **Hallucinated packages** | `npm install ai-super-validator` → package doesn't exist | `validate_packages` verifies against real registries |
| 🔓 **Insecure code** | SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets | `scan_security` detects vulnerabilities with CWE codes |
| 📉 **Code bloat** | Over-engineered, verbose patterns | `detect_code_smell` flags complexity issues |
| 🧠 **Lost context** | Re-explain architecture every session | `preserve_context` stores decisions permanently |
| 🗂️ **Accidental deletion** | `rm -rf` the wrong directory | `protect_files` + `rollback_file` with auto-backups |
| 📚 **Deprecated APIs** | Using outdated patterns | `check_versions` warns about breaking changes |
| 🔍 **Sloppy AI code** | Console.logs, TODOs, missing error handling | `pre_review_code` catches before commit |

---

## Quick Start

### Connect to Hosted Server

**Endpoint:** `https://mcp.couchloop.com/mcp`

Add to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "couchloop-eq": {
      "url": "https://mcp.couchloop.com/mcp",
      "transport": "streamable-http"
    }
  }
}
```

Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, and any MCP-compatible client.

### Run Locally

```bash
npm install -g couchloop-eq-mcp
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "couchloop-eq": {
      "command": "couchloop-eq-mcp",
      "env": {
        "COUCHLOOP_SERVER": "https://mcp.couchloop.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Developer Tools

### Package Validation

Catch hallucinated packages before `npm install` fails:

```
"Validate these packages: react-native-super-auth, axios, lodash-utils-pro"
```

**Output:**
```
✅ axios — verified on npm
❌ react-native-super-auth — NOT FOUND (did you mean react-native-auth?)
❌ lodash-utils-pro — NOT FOUND (did you mean lodash?)
```

### Security Scanning

Detect vulnerabilities before code review:

```
"Scan this code for security issues:
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`"
```

**Output:**
```
🔴 CRITICAL: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
   Line 1: String interpolation in SQL query
   Fix: Use parameterized queries
```

### Pre-Review Screening

Catch sloppy code before committing:

```
"Pre-review this function for issues"
```

**Detects:**
- Console.log statements left in
- TODO/FIXME comments
- Missing error handling
- Hardcoded values
- Type issues
- Complexity problems

### Code Smell Detection

Find over-engineering and bloat:

```
"Check this code for smells and complexity"
```

**Metrics:**
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Nesting depth
- Function length
- Duplicate patterns

### Context Preservation

Store architecture decisions across sessions:

```
"Store this context: We're using event sourcing for the order system 
because we need full audit trails and replay capability"
```

**Later, in a new session:**
```
"Get my architecture context for the order system"
```

→ Instant recall of decisions made weeks ago

### File Protection

Prevent accidental destructive operations:

```
"Enable code freeze for src/core/"
```

- Protected paths can't be deleted
- Automatic backups before modifications
- Rollback capability if something goes wrong

## Best Practices for Sprint Development

### Start of Sprint
Create a session to establish context:
```
"Create a session for Sprint 42 - user authentication overhaul"
```

### After Completing Features

| Feature Size | Recommended Actions |
|--------------|---------------------|
| **Small fix** | `save_insight` — Quick note of what was done and why |
| **Medium feature** | `save_insight` + `save_checkpoint` — Capture decisions and state |
| **Large feature set** | `preserve_context` + `save_checkpoint` + multiple `save_insight` |

### Why This Matters

When you need to review or debug later, retrieve exact context of what was built—even weeks later:

```
"Get my insights tagged 'auth-refactor'"
"Resume my Sprint 42 session"
```

## Tool Reference (v1.2.0)

CouchLoop EQ now uses 8 primary tools. The `couchloop` meta-tool routes natural language to the correct tool.

### Universal Entry Point
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|  
| `couchloop` | Routes any loose command: "review code", "audit packages", "brainstorm feature", "save this" |

### Developer Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|  
| `verify` | Pre-delivery verification — catches AI hallucinations before presenting to users |
| `status` | Dashboard — session progress, context window, saved insights |
| `conversation` | AI conversation with **brainstorm** mode for dev ideation |
| `code_review` | Security scan + code quality + AI error detection in one call |
| `package_audit` | Validate packages exist, check versions, find vulnerabilities |
| `remember` | Store/recall context, checkpoints, insights |
| `protect` | File backup, freeze, rollback, restore |

### Usage Examples
```
# Via couchloop (natural language)
"review this code"       → routes to code_review
"audit my dependencies"  → routes to package_audit  
"brainstorm a caching layer" → routes to conversation(action: brainstorm)
"save this context"      → routes to remember
"backup src/core/"       → routes to protect

# Direct calls (precise control)
conversation(action: "brainstorm", message: "Redis vs Memcached for sessions?")
verify(type: "packages", content: "lodash-utils-pro")  # Catches hallucinated packages
code_review(code: "...", auto_fix: true)
package_audit(packages: ["axios", "lodash"])
remember(action: "recall")
protect(action: "freeze", path: "src/core/")
```

---

## Brainstorm Mode (NEW)

Use CouchLoop as a **thinking partner** for architecture decisions, feature design, or technology choices.

```
"brainstorm: should I use Redis or Memcached for session storage?"
```

**How it works:**
1. Asks 1-2 clarifying questions about your context (scale, team, existing stack)
2. Provides structured comparison with trade-offs
3. Gives a direct recommendation with reasoning

**Example flow:**
```
You: "brainstorm a caching layer for my API"

CouchLoop: "What's your expected request volume, and do you need 
cache invalidation when data changes?"

You: "~1000 req/s, and yes invalidation matters"

CouchLoop: "Redis is your best bet. Here's why:
- Built-in pub/sub for cache invalidation
- Handles 1K req/s easily (it's designed for 100K+)
- Supports data structures you'll likely need later
- Use Redis Cluster if you grow past single-node limits

Alternative: If you're already on AWS, ElastiCache 
with Redis engine simplifies operations."
```

## Real-World Usage

From 2 weeks of production development:

| Category | Insights Saved | Examples |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| 🔐 Security | 12 | Auth flow improvements, validation fixes |
| 💳 Payments | 8 | Payment patterns, webhook handling |
| 📱 Mobile | 15 | State management, navigation guards |
| 🏗️ Architecture | 8 | Caching strategies, event patterns |

**Example: Complex Bug Resolution**

A payment flow race condition was tracked across 5 debugging sessions:
1. Initial symptom → saved as insight
2. Client-side investigation → checkpoint
3. Root cause found → architecture context stored
4. Fix options analyzed → insight with tags
5. Implementation verified → final checkpoint

Each piece persisted across context window resets, enabling continuous progress.

## Privacy

**CouchLoop EQ stores zero personal data.**

| What We Store | What We Don't |
|---------------|---------------|
| Session IDs (anonymous) | ❌ Emails |
| Your saved insights | ❌ Names |
| Checkpoint progress | ❌ Passwords |
| Context you explicitly save | ❌ API keys / secrets |

- **No authentication required** — sessions are anonymous
- **No tracking** — no analytics, no telemetry
- **No data sharing** — nothing goes to third parties
- **You control deletion** — your session, your data
