# CouchLoop Marketplace Descriptions

## Docker Marketplace

CouchLoop is a deployable control layer that governs LLM behavior in high-trust and emotionally sensitive applications. It runs between your service and any supported language model, inspecting generated output for hallucination, inconsistency, tone drift, and unsafe reasoning before responses are returned to users. CouchLoop does not modify the underlying model and can be integrated as a standalone service or sidecar, making it suitable for containerized, multi-model environments. Teams use CouchLoop to reduce AI-related trust failures, compliance risk, and production incidents without slowing deployment velocity.

## OpenAI GPT Store

CouchLoop provides a governance layer for AI applications that require a higher standard of reliability and emotional safety. It monitors model responses for hallucinations, inconsistency, and unsafe reasoning, intervening before outputs are shown to users. Rather than changing the underlying model, CouchLoop operates as a control system that stabilizes behavior in sensitive contexts. This makes it suitable for use cases where trust, consistency, and responsible deployment matter more than raw generation speed.

## Anthropic Ecosystem

CouchLoop is an external behavioral governance layer designed to constrain LLM behavior in contexts where misalignment, hallucination, or emotional inconsistency can cause harm. It evaluates generated responses prior to delivery, identifying unsafe reasoning patterns and intervening when outputs fail to meet contextual safety thresholds. By operating outside the base model, CouchLoop enables context-specific control without retraining or altering aligned model weights. This makes it well-suited for applications that require adaptive safeguards beyond static prompt-level alignment.
