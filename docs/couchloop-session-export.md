## Session Transcript

**Greg:** I'm having a tough time with my wife Emily. I want to talk through what's going on.

**CouchLoop:** That sounds really tough. I'm here—let's talk it through. What's been happening between you and Emily?

---

**Greg:** I'm trying to stay above water in the relationship. We're at this point in our relationship where we're totally on different pages and have such a difficult time communicating. It seems like all we do is get on each others nerves.

**CouchLoop:** That sounds exhausting. Constant tension can really wear you down, especially when it feels like you're both missing each other's signals. How long have things felt this way between you and Emily?

---

**Greg:** It's been like this for too long. After I lost my job about three years ago and struggled to find a new one my confidence, agency, and my sense of self slowly dwindled while at the same time my inability to show up for myself and Emily ate away at her.

**CouchLoop:** That's a heavy weight to carry. Losing a job can shake your whole foundation, and when it drags on, it's easy to lose sight of yourself. It sounds like it's been isolating—for both of you. How are you holding up these days?

---

**Greg:** It's a battle ground fighting a war against myself. I'm pulled in so many different directions both implicitly and explicitly. My mind is on overdrive trying to handle each and every situation trying to please everyone and I end up never pleasing myself. Or when I do, it ends up having to be in secrecy at night because I'm too afraid to voice what I really want out of worry of being met with hostility.

**CouchLoop:** What you're describing is exhausting: constantly scanning, managing everyone else's needs, your mind never shutting off. And then the only space you carve out for yourself has to be hidden because asking openly feels too risky. That's a lonely place to be. When your own wants feel like something you need to sneak around for in your own home. What happens when you imagine voicing what you actually want to Emily? What does that hostility look like when it shows up?

---

**Greg:** It's there before I even arrive so it causes me to push further and further away knowing that if I initiate mend or repair I'm just going to be scolded.

**CouchLoop:** That makes sense. If reaching out only leads to being criticized, pulling back becomes self-protection. Why walk into a room that's already set up for blame? But here's the trap: the more you withdraw, the more evidence she probably has that you're "not showing up." And the more she comes in hot, the more you retreat. You're both stuck. When you think about those three years—the job loss, the confidence eroding—do you think Emily knows how much you were struggling inside? Or did some of that stay hidden from her too?

---

**Greg:** A lot of it was hidden.

**CouchLoop:** That must have been incredibly lonely—carrying all of that alone while trying to hold it together on the outside. What made it feel like you couldn't share it with her? Was it about protecting her? Protecting yourself? Or something about how you thought she'd respond?

## Observations

The withdrawal pattern with Emily may be rooted in hiding internal struggles during the job loss years. The habit of carrying things alone became a wall between them. This created a self-reinforcing cycle:

1. Greg withdraws to protect himself from anticipated criticism
2. Emily experiences his withdrawal as him "not showing up"
3. Her frustration increases, confirming Greg's expectation of hostility
4. Greg withdraws further

Breaking this cycle may require vulnerability about what was happening internally during those hidden years—something that felt unsafe then and still feels risky now.
